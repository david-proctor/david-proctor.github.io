[Pizzarithmetic Dot Com][pizzarithmetic] is a very sober and serious pizza math application that I co-authored with [Jordan Potter][jopo]. It is designed to bring people closer to one another by ensuring that they will order an appropriate amount of pizza for the size of their pizza party. Turn up your speakers and head to [pizzarithmetic dot com][pizzarithmetic].
