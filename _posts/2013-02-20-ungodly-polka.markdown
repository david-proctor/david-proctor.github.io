Ungodly Polka is the first game jam game I ever made. It was a collaboration between Marta and myself at the University of Victoria’s Tsukino-Con. The theme of the jam was “magical girls,” which I admit that I needed to have explained to me. It’s a simple DDR-like.<!--more-->

This game was written in [crafty.js][crafty] over 48 hours in February 2013. If you’re thinking about using crafty.js for something similar, my thoughts are this: the entity-component system is great, and makes it simple to have something functional very quickly. That said, it has a lot of bugs, including ones I was able to conclusively determine did not originate in my code.
