The Vacuum is a retro point-and-click adventure game that I made in the summer of 2008. It is available for free.<!--more-->

## Summary

In The Vacuum, you play Leo Wallace, a young student headed home for the summer on a 24th-century space freighter when the journey is interrupted by two explosions tearing through the passenger quarters. Stranded in deep space with the crew missing and no help available, you must determine what caused the accident and how to fix it — if it was an accident at all.

I designed this game to be a throwback to the old Sierra adventure games I grew up with, with a few changes for the modern age. This game features a non-linear storyline that responds strongly to player actions at all stages of the plot, and emphasizes character interactions, investigation, and logic over the obtuse and illogical inventory puzzles that were the main cause of the adventure genre’s death in my view. Despite some rather regrettable dialogue, the game was well-received by its audiences, and I’m proud of it.

Thanks to a team of “volunteers”, The Vacuum can be played in English, French, German, or Italian.
