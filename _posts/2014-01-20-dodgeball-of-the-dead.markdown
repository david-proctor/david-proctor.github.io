Dodgeball of the Dead is the entry that I participated in during Global Game Jam 2014. It’s a subjective online first-person shooter with dodgeballs and ghosts, and it’s open-source.<!--more-->

## Summary

Dodgeball of the Dead is a multiplayer shooter that gives the player a second shot at life. The theme of the 2014 Global Game Jam was a quote: “we don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.” Our team was inspired by this to create a subjective first-person shooter.

When you hit another player with a dodgeball, from your perspective, they die. From their perspective, however, they are merely disoriented for a moment, and then continue as normal. To you, they are now a ghost; you can’t see them, but they can “haunt” you by continuing to launch dodgeballs from beyond the grave. The winner is the first player to turn all other players into ghosts.

## Requirements

Hardware requirements are modest. If you have a modern computer with software that is up-to-date as of 2012 or so, you should be able to run the game without problems.

As released, the game only supports LAN play. The host must run the “TNServer.exe” from the Server folder; if Windows asks for network permissions to run it, allow it, and then close and re-open TNServer. The window that appears will tell you the port and IP address after a few seconds. Each player can then open the game and plug the port and IP address in.
