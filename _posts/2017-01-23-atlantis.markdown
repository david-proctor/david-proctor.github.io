Atlantis is the game that I participated in making for the 2017 Global Game Jam. It's a couch-multiplayer undersea collection race. It's available for free.<!--more-->

# Summary

Atlantis is a local multiplayer collection race. Up to four players each control octopuses competing to collect the most sushi from the underwater ruins of Atlantis within the time limit. I joined a team of strangers to create it in 48 hours for the 2017 Global Game Jam. The theme of the jam this year was "waves", which inspired us to make a local multiplayer racing game where players could affect each other using the wakes left behind themselves. The wake concept was eventually dropped, but what was left was a very nifty-looking and fully-functional undersea exploration game. In addition to hunting for and collecting the plates of sushi, players can also steal plates from each other, or let out a jet of ink to confuse attackers.

# Requirements

I was able to run this game on a 2013 Macbook Pro at medium graphics settings.

It also requires a gamepad for each player. We have only tested it using Xbox 360 controllers.
