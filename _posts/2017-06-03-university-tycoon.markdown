University Tycoon is an unfinished satirical simulation game in which you run a university in pursuit of the most important thing the academy produces: money.

# Summary

I worked on it for about a year and a half before I finally admitted to myself that I couldn't "find the fun" in the idea. It's very functional and I learned a lot while putting it together, but it simply wasn't compelling to sit down and play and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. I've made it open-source as a sort of showcase of my programming skills.
